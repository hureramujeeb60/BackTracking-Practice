# üß† Backtracking Practice in Python

Welcome to my **Backtracking Practice** repository! This repo contains Python solutions to classic backtracking problems, often asked in coding interviews and competitive programming.

## üìö What is Backtracking?

Backtracking is a recursive algorithmic technique used for solving problems that involve **decision trees**, such as generating combinations, permutations, or solving constraint-based puzzles. It works by:

1. **Making choices** from available options
2. **Recursively exploring** the consequences of each choice
3. **Undoing choices** (backtracking) when they lead to invalid solutions
4. **Finding all solutions** or the optimal solution

## üéØ Problem Descriptions

### 1. **Combination Sum** (`combination.py`)
Given an array of distinct integers and a target, find all unique combinations where the chosen numbers sum to target. The same number may be chosen unlimited times.

**Example:**
```python
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
```

### 2. **Letter Combinations** (`letterCombinations.py`)
Given a string containing digits from 2-9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent (like on a phone keypad).

**Example:**
```python
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
```

### 3. **N-Queens** (`nQueens.py`)
Place N chess queens on an N√óN board so that no two queens attack each other.

**Example:**
```python
Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
```

### 4. **Permutations** (`permutatons.py`)
Generate all possible permutations of a given list of numbers.

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
```

### 5. **Subsets** (`subset.py`)
Generate all possible subsets (the power set) of a given set of distinct integers.

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]
```

### 6. **Word Search** (`wordSearch.py`)
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

**Example:**
```python
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: True
```

### 7. **Rat in a Maze** (`ratMaze.py`)
Find all possible paths for a rat to travel from top-left to bottom-right in a maze.

**Example:**
```python
Input: maze = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,1],[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,1]]
Output: ["DDRDRR","DRDDRR"]
```

### 8. **Knight's Tour Validation** (`knightConfigurations.py`)
Check if a given configuration represents a valid knight's tour on a chessboard.

## üìà Complexity Analysis

| Problem | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Combination Sum | O(N^(T/M)) | O(T/M) |
| Letter Combinations | O(4^N √ó N) | O(N) |
| N-Queens | O(N!) | O(N¬≤) |
| Permutations | O(N! √ó N) | O(N) |
| Subsets | O(2^N √ó N) | O(N) |
| Word Search | O(N √ó M √ó 4^L) | O(L) |
| Rat in a Maze | O(2^(N¬≤)) | O(N¬≤) |
| Knight's Tour | O(8^(N¬≤)) | O(N¬≤) |

*Where N = array/board size, M = minimum candidate value, T = target value, L = word length*

## üîë Key Backtracking Patterns

### 1. **Basic Template**
```python
def backtrack(path, choices):
    if is_solution(path):
        solutions.append(path[:])
        return
    
    for choice in choices:
        if is_valid(choice):
            path.append(choice)
            backtrack(path, remaining_choices)
            path.pop()  # Undo the choice
```

### 2. **Common Techniques**
- **Pruning**: Skip branches that cannot lead to valid solutions
- **State restoration**: Undo changes after exploring a branch
- **Memoization**: Cache results for overlapping subproblems
- **Early termination**: Stop when a solution is found (if only one is needed)

## üß™ Testing

Each solution includes a `__main__` block with test cases. To add your own tests:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Add your test cases here
    test_input = [...]
    solution = Solution()
    result = solution.method_name(test_input)
    print(f"Input: {test_input}")
    print(f"Output: {result}")
```
