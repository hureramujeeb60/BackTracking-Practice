# üß† Backtracking Practice in Python

Welcome to my **Backtracking Practice** repository! This repo contains Python solutions to classic backtracking problems, often asked in coding interviews and competitive programming.

Backtracking is a recursive algorithmic technique used for solving problems that involve **decision trees**, such as generating combinations, permutations, or solving constraint-based puzzles.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each Python file in this repo represents a self-contained backtracking problem:

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `combination_sum.py` | Find all combinations of numbers that sum to a target. Numbers may be reused. |
| `letter_combination.py` | Generate all letter combinations from a digit string (like "23") using a phone keypad mapping. |
| `n_queens.py` | Classic N-Queens problem ‚Äì place N queens on an N√óN board such that no two queens attack each other. |
